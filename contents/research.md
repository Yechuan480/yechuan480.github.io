*The origin of water-ice in the lunar regolith：Constraints from lunar meteorites*
 
Supervisor： Prof. Jia Liu

· The origin of lunar regolith water is unclear： Solar Wind, Meteorites, Cosmic Dust, Molecular Clouds?

· To constrain the origin of H20 in lunar regolith
        
· Focus on Hydrogen isotope in alteration minerals
           
· Done the basic mineral identification by microscope and SEM
           
· Determing the isotope composition by SIMS
