*The origin of water-ice in the lunar regolith：Constraints from lunar meteorites*.\
 
Supervisor： Prof. Jia Liu.\

- The origin of lunar regolith water is unclear： Solar Wind, Meteorites, Cosmic Dust, Molecular Clouds?.\

- To constrain the origin of H20 in lunar regolith.\
         
- Focus on Hydrogen isotope in alteration minerals.\
           
- Done the basic mineral identification by microscope and SEM.\
           
- Determing the isotope composition by SIMS.\
