#### Bio

Hi, welcome to my homepage! My name is Yilin(Harry) Lu, and I’m pursuing my bachelor’s degree(with honors) at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I'm a triple-major Computer Science, Mathematics, and Quantitative Economics student. I also minor in Statistical Science. Before college, I studied Mathematics at San Diego State University through the Dual Enrollment Option and graduated from Torrey Pines High School.

My current research interests are human-computer interactions, visualization, and data science in general. Currently, I’m primarily working with [Prof. Qianwen Wang](https://github.com/wangqianwen0418) as a project lead at [Visual Intelligence Lab, UMNTC](https://github.com/UMN-Visual-Intelligence-Lab). During my first freshman semester at the UMNTC, I was a science intern at TURBO Telescope Group at the Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics, where my work was crowdsourcing systems for science discovery, and my PIs were [Prof. Patrick Kelly](https://github.com/patkel) and [Dr. Mandeep S Gill](https://github.com/mssgill).

In my free time, I enjoy visual arts, reading, cooking, origami, and game design(especially strategic and simulation games). If we have any common research interests, please feel free to reach out to me using the methods below.
